Remediation Advice
============================================================
#1 [Critical] to fingerprint the web stack, enumerate common content, and identify known vulnerabilities from public sources (nvd, wpscan).
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Suppress or obfuscate version banners (Apache, Nginx, PHP, etc.).
-> Remove unnecessary plugins/services that leak stack info.
-> Regularly update software to reduce fingerprinting risk.
-> Monitor vulnerability feeds (NVD, WPScan, CVE) for components in use.
------------------------------------------------------------
#2 [Critical] directory brute force with redirect/false-positive suppression
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Disable directory listing in the web server config.
-> Use proper 403/404 responses instead of redirects.
-> Restrict access to sensitive paths with authN/authZ.
-> Monitor logs for repeated probing attempts.
------------------------------------------------------------
#3 [Critical] source
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Verify no sensitive source code or config files are publicly accessible.
-> Restrict direct access to `.git`, `.env`, `.bak`, `.old`, and backup files.
-> Ensure deployment excludes debug/test files.
-> Consider WAF rules to block source code probing.
------------------------------------------------------------
#4 [Critical] harden wordpress (if applicable): restrict admin endpoints, keep core/plugins/themes updated, enforce mfa.
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Update Elementor plugin and WordPress themes to the latest secure version.
-> Remove unused or vulnerable plugins/themes.
-> Verify no insecure external resources are loaded.
-> Backup site before making changes.
-> Test site functionality after updates.
------------------------------------------------------------
#5 [Critical] + no cgi directories found (use '-c all' to force check all possible dirs)
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Confirm no unnecessary CGI directories are exposed.
-> Disable or remove legacy CGI handlers if unused.
-> Apply least privilege execution for scripts.
-> Audit and restrict scripts to trusted functionality only.
------------------------------------------------------------
#6 [Medium] + /: the anti-clickjacking x-frame-options header is not present. see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/http/headers/x-frame-options
   - Why dangerous: Security misconfigurations or missing headers may allow attacks.
   - What’s at risk: Users, web application behavior.
   - Potential exploit: Clickjacking, information disclosure, minor privilege misuse.
-> Add X-Frame-Options header to block clickjacking.
-> Implement CSP headers for stronger protection.
-> Test across browsers for enforcement.
------------------------------------------------------------
#7 [Low] minimize server info leaks (server/x-powered-by headers), enable security headers (csp, hsts, etc.).
   - Why dangerous: Information disclosure or minor misconfigurations.
   - What’s at risk: Low-risk data, server banners, site structure.
   - Potential exploit: Reconnaissance, enumeration, minimal impact attacks.
