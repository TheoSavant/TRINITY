#1 [Critical] to fingerprint the web stack, enumerate common content, and identify known vulnerabilities from public sources (nvd, wpscan).
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Manual review required for this finding.
------------------------------------------------------------
#2 [Critical] directory brute force with redirect/false-positive suppression
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Manual review required for this finding.
------------------------------------------------------------
#3 [Critical] source
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Manual review required for this finding.
------------------------------------------------------------
#4 [Critical] harden wordpress (if applicable): restrict admin endpoints, keep core/plugins/themes updated, enforce mfa.
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Update Elementor plugin and WordPress themes to the latest secure version.
-> Remove unused or vulnerable plugins/themes.

-> Backup site before making changes.
-> Test site functionality after updates.
------------------------------------------------------------
#5 [Critical] + no cgi directories found (use '-c all' to force check all possible dirs)
   - Why dangerous: A known vulnerability exists that can be exploited remotely.
   - What’s at risk: Server, website, or database; sensitive business data.
   - Potential exploit: Attackers can gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or execute code.
-> Manual review required for this finding.
------------------------------------------------------------
#6 [Medium] + /: the anti-clickjacking x-frame-options header is not present. see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/http/headers/x-frame-options
   - Why dangerous: Security misconfigurations or missing headers may allow attacks.
   - What’s at risk: Users, web application behavior.
   - Potential exploit: Clickjacking, information disclosure, minor privilege misuse.
-> Add X-Frame-Options headers to prevent clickjacking.
-> Implement CSP headers.
-> Test site in multiple browsers for enforcement.
------------------------------------------------------------
#7 [Low] minimize server info leaks (server/x-powered-by headers), enable security headers (csp, hsts, etc.).
